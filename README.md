Project SORA is Scientific Observatory Acoustics Research for communication and control of the 7-kilometer wide triangle aerial 
spacecraft of 1997 Phoenix Lights event. SORA is the observation of psychic telecommunication with advanced civilizations of 
Jupiter-sized spacecrafts. The teleportation of spacecrafts.

The photo of the ocean is from Northern California bay. I designed a new scientific technical process in which our thoughts may 
make the 16-kilometer wide spacecraft appear above the ocean. The process requires a photograph recorded from the morning from 
6:00am to 10:00am of the designated location of the ocean or bay for LOKD consciousness telecommunication or telemetry-radionics # (TREK). LOKD ( pronounced "locked") is a visualization technique to manifest and telecommunicate a technology and civilization 
from the future year 8000. The objective is to network with a hypothetical interdimensional universe or extraterrestrial galactic # quadrant. The project requires recording hand-written tabular data unto a non-computerized notebook at intervals of 5 minutes per # VTR session (virtual visualization telecommunication). By simply visualizing in the blue sky above the ocean, a 23 kilometer-wide # boomerang shape spacecraft called the Supremacy from the Walt Disney motion film picture Star Wars. A digital print of the 
spacecraft Supremacy must be placed next to the electromagnetic field detector (EMF - use a K2). The participant must be 
monitored with the Emotiv EEG headband during the visualization process. This can be accomplished while standing in front of the # view of the ocean waves or the bay in daylight.
